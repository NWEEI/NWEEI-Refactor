<blockquote>
<p>If someone asked us to guess how much time it’ll take to get to the store, or how much a car weighs, or how tall a house is, we’ll probably be pretty close. But ask us about energy, and we can be wrong by many orders of magnitude.</p>
<small>Clark Williams-Derry <cite title="Source Title">Sightline Institute</cite></small></blockquote>

INSERT IGNORE INTO Articles VALUES (7,'Mission & History','<p class="lead">The Northwest Water &amp; Energy Education Institute (NWEEI) offers both standard and custom learning opportunities throughout the Northwest&nbsp;for energy and water industry practitioners – including an <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11871:energy-management-certificate-emc&amp;catid=2:certification-courses&amp;Itemid=12">energy management certification</a> program. NWEEI is located within the Science Department at Lane Community College.&nbsp; Starting in 2018 all Energy Classes have been offered online and in Fall of 2019 the Water Conservation Program is also online.&nbsp; Great opportunities for folks outside of the Lane Community College area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guided by a regionarticlesarticlesal advisory board, NWEEI has provided energy efficiency training and development throughout the Northwest region since 1998. Participants have included technicians, contractors, engineers, architects, consultants, utility personnel, and energy managers.</p>
<p>The Energy Management Program offered through Lane Community College has ties back as far as 1980 when Alan Gubrud, a physics instructor, obtained a grant from the National Science Foundation to develop a curriculum that combined the principles of basic physics with energy analysis techniques. Students gained a working understanding of energy systems in the built environment and the tools to analyze and quantify energy efficiency efforts. The program began with an emphasis on residential energy efficiency / general solar energy systems and has evolved to include technician level commercial energy efficiency, renewable energy system installation and water conservation skillsets.</p>
<p>For over 30 years, the organization has successfully provided significant opportunities to train professional technicians who can immediately contribute to energy and cost savings in their own communities and was the first college in the nation to offer a degree in energy management. The Energy Management Program was named 2002/03 Innovation of the Year by the League for Innovation and received the Award of Recognition from the U.S. Secretary of Education in 1983.</p>
<p>In 2006, Lane Community College began the Water Conservation Technician program.&nbsp; Classes included Residential, Landscape, Agriculture, Mechanical Systems and Commerical/Industrial Water.&nbsp; In addition, students studied Regional Water Policy and Integrated Water Management.&nbsp; Some changes have been made but most of these same classes remain.&nbsp; Our students are now from the Western United States.&nbsp; And we have added Alternative Water Sources, Stormwater and Codes and Policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both programs are now partnering with a wider geographic group of partners. Give us a call to see what we can offer.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Energy Management Certification - July 9 - 20, 2012</h1>
<p>EMC is an <strong>advanced certification program</strong> that requires the student to implement an energy-saving project, and measure the results.</p>
<p>This program goes beyond the fundamentals and <strong>teaches a broad spectrum of energy management principles and techniques.</strong> Topics include building energy use, glazing, insulation, building envelope, heating/cooling, secondary HVAC, controls, central plant equipment, energy auditing, operation and maintenance. Each topic is covered by a discipline expert.</p>
<hr id="system-readmore" />
<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/8461228" frameborder="0" height="300" width="400"></iframe>
<p>In the Spring of 2003, an independent evaluation of the EMC program was conducted. The resulting “Market Progress Evaluation Report” examines the NEEI program over the years 2000-2002. <a href="images/pdf_files/EMC_Evaluation.pdf" title="EMC Evaluation" class="jce_file"> <img src="plugins/editors/jce/tiny_mce/plugins/filemanager/img/ext/pdf_small.gif" style="border:0px;vertical-align:middle;" title="pdf" class="jce_fm_icon" />EMC Evaluation <span class="jce_fm_size">690.43 Kb</span></a></p>
<p>The following are direct quotes from EMC students, as reported in Con.WEB’s article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“The Energy Management Certification Program offers learning and dollar savings”</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“Professional energy education can provide more than learning” </em></p>
<p><em>“It can also bring financial benefits to organizations, as shown by the Energy Management Certification program offered by the Northwest Energy Education Institute” </em></p>
<p><em>“EMC graduates are creating substantial energy bill savings for their employers, stemming from efficiency projects required for certification as well as from training at EMC workshops. These attributable dollar savings can reach tens of thousands of dollars annually” </em></p>

<p>Students of the Energy Management Certification Program share their EMC experience:</p>
<h4>Susan Pommier</h4>
<p><em>Specialist<br />Portland General Electric | Portland, Oregon</em></p>
<p>I have a few minutes, so thought I’d send a note thanking you for all the work you put into our energy management class. It’s obvious to me that it’s a huge undertaking.</p>
<p>I think all of us would agree that those two weeks were special in a couple of ways. First, we learned so much beneficial information, that will impact all of us forever (yes, even me). Second, we formed some friendships that will always be valued. You have a special place in our hearts.</p>
<p>Looking back on it, I’m sorry that it’s over. I have every intention of keeping in touch with all of you. Thanks for everything.</p>

<h4>Katherine Morris</h4>
<p><em>Assistant to the Director<br />Oregon State University | University Housing &amp; Dining Services</em></p>
<p>I am a Resource Conservation Management Program Coordinator with three years experience working with 4, 000 residential students living in residence halls, coops and family student housing for 24 hours a day and seven days a week. My job is to teach and continuously motivate them to conserve energy, to reduce waste and hopefully to understand why sustainability is so important.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing about participating in the EMC Boot Camp was to receive so many resources that would take a career to build, added with daily lectures that left you wanting to leave the training to get home to start your project. This didn’t end at the close of training, we were all anxious to get back and hit the ground running with our projects.</p>
<p>Teachers were expert in their areas of electrical fundamentals, lighting, insulation, HVAC systems, plant equipment and outstanding instruction with energy auditing and life cycle cost analysis and more. If you are not a technician this training is great; it exposes you to the trade’s maintenance areas so that you will be able to understand and work with these professionals when you return to work in the field. The training was enriching with several nights of guest speakers who shared their years of wisdom and presented some of their career projects. EMC Boot Camp attendees from last year attended one evening–yes we got to see there presentations!</p>
<p>Creature Comforts were great and provided us with an opportunity to have maximum opportunities to explore training ideas with our fellow Boot Camp students. My only disappointment was that I didn’t get to do this training three years ago, when I first embarked on Resource Conservation Management.</p>

<h4>Gary Briley</h4>
<p><em>Energy Manager<br />Spring Branch School District | Houston, Texas</em></p>
<p>I have used a lot of what I learned in your course on a daily basis. You and your subject matter experts gave me the base knowledge and insight to take and steer a quality EM program in the right direction. I even feel that I am somewhat an expert in what we are trying to pull together for our EM department and maintenance. When my confidence level is high, I feel that I can accomplish anything!!</p>
<p>You and Mike helped create this monster!! All the people in the district have been great in their response to the Energy Management program. It’s all about approach, timing, and appropriate communication.</p>','2008-07-08 23:19:05',NULL,4,1,'2008-07-11 07:19:05',0,2420);

<h3>Energy-Efficient Operation of Commercial Buildings<br />Redefining the Energy Manager’s Job</h3>
<p>by Peter Herzog</p>
<h2>Commercial Efficiency Book IN PRINT!</h2>
<p><em>Peter Herzog’s excellent reference, Energy Efficient Operation of Commercial Buildings, is back in print and available through NWEEI.</em></p>
<p>Today’s commercial buildings are complex super-systems that rely, not only on the efficient operation of individual equipment components, but on sub-systems of these components, and on control systems. Over time components and systems tend to wander from their design operational points and controls tend to drift from their set-points. Typically this means less efficient operation and greater energy and operation costs. Often this decreased performance goes unnoticed.</p><p><img src="images/book3.gif" alt="diagram illustrating a mechanical system (HVAC) and occupant comfort in different spaces" width="200" height="369" style="float: left;" />In Peter Herzog’s words: “Most people assume that standard operating and maintenance practices will ensure energy efficiency, but the truth is that very few facilities have processes in place to ensure energy-efficient operation. As a result, most facilities needlessly waste 10 to 25 percent of the energy they purchase.”</p>
<p>In 197 well-written pages, amply and creatively illustrated by John Carmody, Energy- Efficient Operation of Commercial Buildings lays out a simple and logical process for ensuring operation efficiency of typical building systems. The process is amplified through numerous examples and flow charts.</p>
<p>Peter Herzog provides a method, analysis techniques, and the step-by-step guidance that will permit a facility operator or energy manager to tap into the same energy and cost savings available to paid performance contractors – while keeping the savings in house.</p>
<blockquote>This is a must-have book for anyone operating a building. NWEEI has arranged with the author to make available a soft cover, spiral bound edition of this book at the affordable price of $65.00 plus shipping and handling.(While the book can be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Efficient-Operation-Commercial-Buildings-Redefining/dp/0070284687/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394566046&amp;sr=1-1" title="Search for this book on Amazon">found on Amazon</a> they have often charged anywhere from $100-200 )</blockquote>

My job is to teach and continuously motivate them to conserve energy, to reduce waste and hopefully to understand why sustainability is so important.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing about participating in the EMC Boot Camp was to receive so many resources that would take a career to build, added with daily lectures that left you wanting to leave the training to get home to start your project. This didn’t end at the close of training, we were all anxious to get back and hit the ground running with our projects.</p>
<p>Teachers were expert in their areas of electrical fundamentals, lighting, insulation, HVAC systems, plant equipment and outstanding instruction with energy auditing and life cycle cost analysis and more. If you are not a technician this training is great; it exposes you to the trade’s maintenance areas so that you will be able to understand and work with these professionals when you return to work in the field. The training was enriching with several nights of guest speakers who shared their years of wisdom and presented some of their career projects. EMC Boot Camp attendees from last year attended one evening–yes we got to see there presentations!</p>

<p>As business and industry are taking more interest in renewable energy, academia is not far behind. Anticipating increased demand for new technical and design skills, colleges and universities across the nation are offering degree programs in the field.</p>
<blockquote>More community colleges are offering one-year certificates and two-year associate degrees in building and installing clean-energy systems. Lane Community College, in Eugene, Ore., trains renewable-energy technicians in a two-year program that teaches students how to improve the energy efficiency of homes and businesses and install solar-power and wind-power systems.</blockquote>

<strong>SOLARPRO | December/January 2009</strong><em><br />By Lisa Cohn and Elisa Wood, with Charles Thurston</em><br /><br />Community and junior colleges have stepped up to train workers for the emerging green-collar economy. Solar companies partner with colleges to help them develop curriculum materials and design programs, particularly for solar installers—then they recruit their graduates. “The community college system is an excellent way for employers to find well-qualified applicants. Part of the reason is that we’re so connected to the industry,” says John Carrese, director of the San Francisco Bay Center of Excellence, hosted at City College of San Francisco.<br /><br />
<blockquote>Lane Community College in Eugene, Oregon, for instance, offers an Energy Management Technician degree with an optional emphasis on renewable energy. The rigorous 100-credit program is housed in the Science Division and is ISPQ accredited by the Institute of Sustainable Power. Program Coordinator Roger Ebbage says the program began in September 2003 and has seen this year’s enrollment nearly triple the first year’s.</blockquote>

<p><em>Submitted by Willi Paul on Sat, 12/26/2009 - 11:37<br />Origionally published on <a href="http://www.planetshifter.com/node/1451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.planetshifter.com/node/1451</a></em></p>
<div class="p1">
<p><strong>Q: Why is your </strong><a href="http://lanecc.edu/science/energyMgmt/index.html"><span class="s1"><strong>Lane College Energy Management Program</strong></span></a><strong> a national model for energy education? How many competing programs are out there?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p>ROGER: One reason for our place in the energy education industry is that we have been the only program in the country for many years. It was not until recently that we have helped other programs with getting into the game. And then of course since we focus on quality instruction, we have a reputation of providing a solid course or program. We are also involved with the industry nationally so we stay tuned into what’s happening from a national perspective.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="p1">&nbsp;</div><div class="p1">
<p><strong>Managing a building or campus energy program is more than assessment and reduction strategies. What are your green building best practices and principles?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p>Really, its assessment and reduction strategies. If you don’t know where you stand how will know where you need to go. If you don’t encourage reduction through low cost – no cost strategies you will struggle to implement projects be cause of first costs. Energy reduction can lead to a revenue stream that will finance capital projects. Very simply, get end users involved in reduction strategies and you have a successful program</p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p><strong>Please discuss the current market trends in energy-efficiency.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p>Although we haven’t seen al lot of funding going toward commercial building efficiency, we are seeing some dollars hitting the low income residential market and really, commercial energy efficiency is coming up in a lot of conversations which is different from 2 years ago where one needed to convince building owners to do efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p><strong>How is the green speak from the Obama machine fairing in Oregon these days?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p>Money to fund proposals is coming in and we are getting our fair share – I’m sure.</p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p><strong>How do you audit or assess a building for energy use?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p>First you need to know where the building stands and that’s done by calculating the Energy Utilization Index in BTUs / square foot of conditioned space. Based on that figure one can benchmark the building with others to see where the building stands compared to high performance buildings.</p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p>Next is a scoping walk-through to determine what technology needs further assessment. The final step then is conducting the assessment and reporting the findings with recommendations for improvement. Sounds simple but involves a lot of time, technology and creative knowledge to be done right.</p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p><strong>Tell us how you found and won the NSF grant for Lane College?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p>The NSF grant is designed to provide the Lane program to other college energy management cohorts through distance learning. We will put all of our core courses on line starting fall 2010 which when coupled with general ed courses taken at the down-link campus, students can earn our degree<span class="s2"><br /> </span>.<span class="s2"><br /> </span><strong>Can solar energy save the planet? How?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p>Save the planet??? Hmmm – I would say not. What I would suggest is that a hybrid mix of renewables can go a long way toward saving the planet. Connect renewables with responsible leadership, good policy making, and an informed populace and we are home free.</p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p><strong>Why did you join the </strong><a href="http://irecusa.org/"><span class="s1"><strong>Interstate Renewable Energy Council</strong></span></a><strong>? What is going on there?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p>I work with some of the most dedicated and talented renewable energy professionals in the world through IREC. For instance, the organization has the experience of past interest in renewable energy to the degree that they knew if we didn’t get installers of renewable systems to install using practices that come from a skill set identified by successful practitioners we would have the same poor installations that almost destroyed the industry in the early 80. I like being with forward thinking organizations. IREC is one of those.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>How critical are </strong><a href="http://www.planetshifter.com/node/1400"><span class="s1"><strong>grey water systems</strong></span></a><strong> to a sustainable future?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="p1">
<p>I like Grey water systems but if we don’t keep our codes people current grey water systems won’t be as common as they need to be. Water by the way is THE most important resource to conserve.<span class="s2"><br /> </span></p>
<p><strong>Are you working with businesses and residents to sell back energy to the grid?</strong><br />No.</p>

<p>“I had the pleasure of attending Roger Ebbage’s “Energy Conservation” class as part of my Building Operator Certification course. Typically, it’s difficult for me to stay seated for hours, listening to a lecture. But Roger’s class gave us an important overview of our role as “building operators” in energy consumption and how to identify potential areas in our facilities so we can improve operations and achieve system efficiency which can have a huge impact on the bottom line. His passion in energy and water conservation is evident in the multitude of reading materials that he shared. It was infectious enough that class participation was active and animated. We need more people like him to spread this critical message.”</p>

<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.''s reputation as a resolute defender of the  environment stems from a litany of successful legal actions. Mr. Kennedy  was named one of TIME magazine''s “Heroes for the Planet” for his  success in helping Riverkeeper lead the fight to restore the Hudson  River. The group''s achievement helped spawn more than 160 Waterkeeper  organizations across the globe. In 2009, he was named one of Rolling  Stone’s “100 Agents of Change.”</p>
<p>Mr. Kennedy serves as senior attorney for the Natural Resources  Defense Council, chief prosecuting attorney for the Hudson Riverkeeper,  president of Waterkeeper Alliance, is a partner in the clean tech work  of Silicon Valley’s VantagePoint Ventures, and is the environmental  advisor to Napo Pharmaceuticals. He is also a clinical professor and  supervising attorney at Pace University School of Law’s Environmental  Litigation Clinic and is co-host of Ring of Fire on Air America Radio.   Earlier in his career, he served as assistant district attorney in New  York City.</p>
<p>He has worked on environmental issues across the Americas, and has  assisted several indigenous tribes in Latin America and Canada in  successfully negotiating treaties protecting traditional homelands. He  is credited with leading the fight to protect New York City''s water  supply. The New York City watershed agreement, which he negotiated on  behalf of environmentalists and New York City watershed consumers, is  regarded as an international model in stakeholder consensus negotiations  and sustainable development.

<p>From most accounts, investment in energy management services is already creating new jobs. A $2 million energy efficiency construction-related project can create as many as 50 jobs, according to a white paper released by Johnson Controls. And a $10 million EPSCO might account for 95 jobs, according to NAESCO. Finally, energy efficiency programs included in climate change legislation being debated by the Senate could create as many as 20,000 jobs by 2020, according to American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.</p>
<p>At Lane County Community College in Oregon, Roger Ebbage, director of energy and water programs, is hard at work training this new work force. The school is home to the Northwest Energy Education Institute, which has been training the front-line workers of the energy management services industry since 1980. Enrollment in this once-sleepy program tripled over the last two years to 90 and closed for the 2010-2011 academic year by December, says Ebbage.</p><p>The government funding that is currently flowing toward home weatherization for low-income families is creating a demand for a work force that can audit buildings and install the hardware. Money for upgrades to government, commercial and industrial structures also requires people who can interpret the data and interact with the technology that controls building<br />systems.</p>
<p>The first two lessons are ones that Ebbage is able to impart, he says. The last one though, is proving to be harder to pass on to his students.</p>
<p>“The complexity is in how these buildings are controlled,” says Ebbage. New computer-controlled building systems have interfaces that are meant to be user friendly and intuitive, but that doesn’t make it easier for the people who are going to be running them in the future, according to Ebbage. “We have an old guard that doesn’t care how easy it is to interface with these controls,” he says. “They are not interested. And then we have this new group … the problem that we have, they get this computer stuff. What they don’t get is the building systems. They don’t get what it is that they are controlling.”</p>
<p>For all the hurdles and stumbling blocks that exist in the energy management industry, leaders of the sector say that achieving its goals is possible. It’s going to take continual leadership from large energy users, including government, commercial and industrial building owners. And it’s going to take some changes to both how people use energy and how codes and energy policies are updated—and how they are enforced.</p>

The federal government is pouring $500 million into training for green jobs, and the sector devoted to energy efficiency is estimated to grow as much as fourfold in the next decade, to some 1.3 million people, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Its March 2010 report was financed by the Energy Department.

<p>The first year of classes will be shared with the core Energy Management courses. Additional courses have been recommended by our industry advisory committee.</p>
<ul class="bullet-2">
<li>
<h4>NRG 171 - Materials Management / Solid Waste Management</h4>
<p>This course will focus on materials procurement, materials disposal, the supply chain, and material acquisition waste avoidance. Students will be presented various examples of supply chains and how to establish a sustainable procurement program for an organization. Students will learn how to work with vendors to get the information needed to make responsible procurement decisions and then how to prioritize procurement decisions. Waste avoidance and the zero waste concept will be discussed in detail focusing on product stewardship and take-back programs. Field Trips will be part of the curriculum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>NRG 172 - Understanding the LEED Framework and Green Buildings</h4>
<p>LEED Green Building Rating System was developed by the US Green Building Council. LEED provides a complete framework for assessing building performance and meeting sustainability goals. This framework helps define "Green Building" by establishing a common standard of measurement. Based on well-founded scientific standards, LEED emphasizes state of the art strategies for sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection and indoor environmental quality. This course will fully investigate the LEED Framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>NRG 173 - Carbon Footprints for Climate Action in Complex Organizations (GHG/Carbon Footprint)</h4>
<p>Understanding Climate Science from a practitioner’s perspective is a component of this course as is Climate Policy Overview, including the Climate Registry, potential national legislation, and understanding cap and trade. Conducting a greenhouse gas inventory, setting boundaries, data collection, tools and protocols, making calculations, and reporting results will be learned. Developing a climate action strategy and how to prioritize actions will be important outcomes to this course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>NRG 174 - Conducting a Full Sustainability Assessment</h4>
<p>Conducting a sustainability assessment requires research into appropriate indicators and benchmarks for the specific building or organizational end-use. This course will discuss how to select indicators and benchmarks, evaluate them and how to report findings. The course will concentrate on setting goals for performance, selecting and making appropriate calculations and then accurately reporting performance.</p>

<p>My 2 month internship at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sunelec.com/">Sun Electronics International</a>, in Miami, was a success. I sold about $250,000 worth of solar equipment in a month and a half (first 2 weeks learning the ropes) and am working on some large project quotes. I was hired as the Southwest Regional Office Manager and am now located in Phoenix. This is a great opportunity to make an impact and help solve the many energy issues we''re faced with. Both Ryan (Ryan Mayfield) and Bruce (Bruce Kelley) are super instructors in the solar program. I learned a lot from both of them and they''re great folks, very down-to-earth.</p>
<p>I want people to know that it''s very important to have the knowledge  base necessary to suceed. You can acquire that in the LCC (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lanecc.edu/science/energyMgmt/">Lane  Community College</a>) EM/RC/RE (Energy Management, Resource Conservation,  Renewable Energy) program(s). You also have to go further by researching  and learning all aspects of the industry chosen. For solar, this  involves hands-on installation experience and familiarity with all  equipment used, knowledge of incentives, system sizing, grid-tie,  grid-tie with battery backup and off-grid system design, inverter  training, computer proficiency, building code regulations, construction  knowledge, salesperson-ship, a positive attitude, drive, showing up on  time and staying late if necessary, a willingness to go the extra mile  and the ability to work well with other people. Taking workshops at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.solarliving.org/">Solar Energy International, Solar Living Institute</a>, etc. is almost mandatory. It''s a great way to make contacts and network also.</p>
<p>It takes time, effort and money but the reward is worth it- you get  to be employed, which is a good thing, especially since kharma is a rule  and you get back what you put into an endeavor. It''s self-rewarding  when the endeavor is for a good cause like saving the world.</p>

<p>The Community Renewable Energy Feasibility Fund (CREFF) program, was established in 2007 to foster new renewable energy development in the state.  Administered by the Oregon Department of Energy, the program delivers grants to study the feasibility of renewable energy, heat, and fuel projects in Oregon. <a target="_blank" href="http://oregon.gov/ENERGY/RENEW/CREFF.shtml" title="The Community Renewable Energy Feasibility Fund (CREFF)">More about CREFF online.</a></p>
<p>In 2011, funds were dedicated to a two-day feasibility tools workshop. This workshop is geared toward staff at the county, city, economic development district, council of governments, and tribal level that often form the frontline of first-stage renewable energy development.</p>
<p>To assist in creating and facilitating this workshop, the Oregon Department of Energy has enlisted the assistance of the Northwest Energy Education Institute at Lane Community College, a leader in energy education.</p>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>Expert presenters will give a technical overview of each renewable energy technology or topic, with an emphasis on the factors that most affect the feasibility of projects.  Modeling tools, the electric grid and transmission, and financing analysis will be discussed.</p>
<p>The afternoon of Day 2 will cover the application of feasibility software that can be used with multiple technologies and will include hands-on practice.</p>
<p>Participants will also receive a workbook that will include further resources and reference material.</p>

<p>During the last quarter of 2011, our two head custodians and five of our six high school lead custodians attended the level I Building Operator Certification training held in Portland.&nbsp; The series was offered at a discounted rate via collaboration between the Oregon Schools Facility Managers Ass''n and NW Energy Education Institute.&nbsp; Yielding to my pleas, Oregon Dept of Energy also graciously contributed for our benefit.</p>
<p>Initially, the guys had mixed feelings about attending.&nbsp; Most were pleased for an opportunity to learn but there were also some reservations about the value of it, impact on their demanding work schedules, and whether they could do the classwork that would be required.</p>
<p>After the first couple of classes, they were ''all in.''&nbsp; At the end of the series, I was repeatedly thanked for the classes and questioned about Level II.&nbsp; These guys can be quite reserved and at times taciturn, and I was surprised by their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>I asked them for some thank you notes that I could send to you all, and most responded.&nbsp; They are attached to this email.</p>
<p>Most of you have little opportunity to hear from the building operators of K-12 schools.&nbsp; Their challenge is to provide safe, clean and comfortable learning environments - with ever-diminishing resources.&nbsp; The reward of this training for them is genuinely appreciated by them - and by me.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

Apprenticeship  programs are  operated on a voluntary basis by employers, employer  associations or  management, and labor groups. The related classroom  instruction is  given in the program sponsor''s training facility or a  local technical  school or junior college. Apprenticeship in Construction  has been  described as the "doorway to opportunity." Apprentices - at  little cost  to themselves - learn skills they can use the rest of their  lives.  Training gained through apprenticeship has enable many workers to   advance to better jobs.</p>
<p>Apprentices of today are the supervisors, superintendents, and   contractors of tomorrow. Ambitious young persons needn''t stop advancing   once they become a skilled tradesman. Supervisory positions become   available as they improve their skills, knowlege, and ability to direct   and guide people in their trade. Advancement, of course, depends on the   individual.</p>
<p>Through contractual agreement, both the pipefitting and plumbing   trades have Joint Apprenticeship Programs and Committees. Both programs   adhere to regulations and standards which are registered with the Ohio   Apprenticeship Council. The Labor Department''s Bureau of Apprenticeship   and Training assists in the formulation of and the carrying out of the   standards.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Early in 2012, NWEEI began exploring the idea of starting up an International exchange program specifically for energy and water related studies. There was some initial interest in doing a study abroad course in India but our plans have changed a bit. We are not going to India to do a water project. Instead we are going to <a href="http://wilberforcecommunitycollege.wozaonline.co.za/" target="_blank">Wilberforce Community College, Evaton South Africa</a> (outside of Johannesburg) with the intention to install both a Solar PV system and small Solar Hot Water system.</p>
<p>Josh and Roger returned from South Africa in Mid February 2013 after checking out the location, lodging, food, and cultural side trips that we might take. We are looking at a 10 day course starting late in June (2 days travel on either side of the class) coupled with an online preparatory class starting April 1 so everyone will be on the same page regarding Solar PV.</p>
{loadposition article-slideshow-1}
<h3>Total Costs</h3>
<p><strong>We are now looking at $2600-$2800 /per person cost to participate in the program (see the Timeline for payment details).&nbsp; That includes:</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet-2">
<li>Air Fare - arranged by individual traveler &amp; paid directly to airline. We''ll assist you with the timing of the purchase as we track airfare prices.&nbsp; We are expecting the cost to be ~$1,500-$1700.</li>
<li>Travel &amp; Meals - to be paid to NWEEI.&nbsp; Deadline will be posted.<br />
<ul>
<li>To and from the airport</li>
<li>Two field trips (maybe three). Includes admission.</li>
<li>Meals and lodging while at Wilberforce.</li>
<li>Security Cash = 200 Rand (~$20 bucks).&nbsp; This is just a precaution for any emergency situations that may arise requiring a phone call and or if you need help.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Course tuition - Paid to Lane Community College via Enrollment services. There will be two courses offered. The first is a 4 credit <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>online</strong></em></span> course starting <strong>Spring Term April 1</strong> (<a href="https://crater.lanecc.edu:9010/banp/bwckschd.p_disp_detail_sched?term_in=201340&amp;crn_in=44524" target="_blank">NRG155 PV System Design and Installation 1 ONLINE - CRN#44524</a>) for those of you who have not already taken PV and solar water heating from our renewable program. If you already are (or have previously), you will not need to sign up and take the online portion of the program.<br /><br />The other is the 3-4 credit on-site course while in SA (<a href="https://crater.lanecc.edu/banp/bwckschd.p_disp_detail_sched?term_in=201410&amp;crn_in=11291" target="_blank">NRG157 Renewable Energy Systems - CRN#11291</a> ). The purpose for this course is to give you credit for your education but also so you will have insurance while on the road. You can use the courses in your degree program as electives and or course substitutions. Our plans are to be installing a PV system w/battery back up and a solar thermal system for the dining hall hot water.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expenses to consider that are not included in the budget above</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet-2">
<li>Passport Book = ~$155 ($110 Application fee + $25 Execution Fee + $20 photo)</li>
<li>Immunization = Yellow Fever is suggested but left up to individual - ~$100. Because we will be working with metal, yourTetanus shots should also be up to date.<br /><a href="http://traveltips.usatoday.com/medical-shots-needed-travel-south-africa-1228.html">http://traveltips.usatoday.com/medical-shots-needed-travel-south-africa-1228.html</a><br />Summary: If for some reason our flight is diverted to another country that has Yellow Fever and you can not display your immunization record, you may be forced to recieve the immunization (and pay for it) before being allowed to continue on your flight(s) most likely causing delays in travel.</li>
<li>Meals while at the airport(s) = $60-80</li>
<li>Snacks, Coffee, Tea Comfort items = $50</li>
<li>Gifts, cellphones, phone cards = $Up to you!</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Building representatives say the Downtown Center is basically “one giant classroom” from the top floor down thanks to several green elements and the incorporation of real building function into the student work environment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">On the green side, the building is going after a LEED Platinum status. LEED Platinum is one of the highest rankings for sustainable building projects as set by the U.S. Green Building Council. Throughout its design and construction, crews incorporated elements like a significant use of natural light, using the heat of the earth to help control air temperature, also using plants and water to help shed and reuse rainwater.</p>

<p>When Lane Community College Energy Management Program Coordinator Roger Ebbage calls the new downtown campus academic building "the building that teaches," students believe it.</p>
<p>"The first week we were just walking around with our necks craned, looking up," says student Amy Hill, 27. They were looking at the ceiling, where intentional gaps in acoustical tiles expose the building''s essential heating, electrical, and water systems.</p>
<p>The building opened to students in January 2013, but the program has been around for more than two decades. It is still one of just a handful of community college energy management programs in the country, thanks in part to generous support from the Eugene Water and Electric Board. Classes used to be scattered around Lane''s main campus, Ebbage notes; if instructors wanted students to see a particular heating or water system, "we had to leave our building and go to another building on campus or downtown to see it. Now they''re all inside the same building shell."</p><p>The building systems include geothermal wells for heating, rainwater cisterns for landscape irrigation and toilet flushing, solar-thermal arrays for water heating, solar electricity, rooftop vegetation for carbon reduction, and passive temperature, ventilation and lighting systems. Plus natural airflow for cooling—something Hill and classmate Lauren Sternfeld tested for themselves the first week of winter term by blowing bubbles on the ground floor and watching them waft up the staircase, just as they were supposed to. All these systems will be on display on Friday, March 15, during the building''s public grand opening from 1-3 p.m.</p>
<p>With a thorough understanding of how buildings operate, graduates are prepared to work in a variety of jobs, Ebbage says. Roy Smith, 51, laid off after 17 years in the timber industry, enrolled hoping to prepare for a job he could stay in until retirement—and specifically hoping to do residential energy audits. He recently interned at EWEB doing just that.</p>
<p>"This is the wave of the future, where the jobs are going to be, and we want to be the people to fill those jobs," says Sternfeld, 28, who found that her bachelor''s degree in business and recreation management had prepared her for a career she didn''t find satisfying. "It feels good to be part of an industry that''s making a positive change." She and her fellow second-year students are glad the program''s new downtown home was completed before they graduated.</p>
<p>The Downtown Campus is regarded as a landmark project for education, business and the community. It allows Lane to offer training and services at an accessible, convenient location while stimulating downtown revitalization and fulfilling sustainability goals.</p>
<p>"Our instructors are still learning the building," Hill notes. "I think next year''s students are going to have it even better."</p>','2013-03-15 23:52:17',NULL,17,1,'2013-03-15 23:52:17',0,11470);

<h4>What''s up with the new name and updated logo?</h4>
<p>Some of you may (or may not) have noticed a small change on our website and materials.&nbsp; With the addition of water education into our 2-year degree programs and training expertise, we thought it prudent to have those changes represented within our name and within our logo. Our website address will remain as it has been for years (nweei.org).&nbsp; Although it may seem a small change to some, this large step forward enables the organization to continue to be the preferred source of cost-effective, innovative, high-quality energy and water education designed to quickly respond to industry and societal trends.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting notes about the new logo:</strong></p>
<p>The letter forms are intentionally coupled together in a way that makes intuitive sense.</p>
<ul>
<li>The N stands by itself for “Northwest”</li>
<li>The W and the E are connected and groups the subject matter that we cover</li>
<li>The E and the I are connected because it’s defining that we are an “Education(al) Institute”</li>
</ul>
<p>Elements were taken from the old logo to make sure the new one doesn’t look <em>TOO</em> different from it’s origins.&nbsp; This includes the letter forms used for the “N” one of the “E”s and a slightly modified version of the “i” with the star (or sun/certificate looking stamp).&nbsp; We tried to keep the “W” in a similar style but more loose and flowing (like water!).&nbsp; The curvy “w” and "e" look a bit space age (<a href="http://www.logodesignlove.com/nasa-logo" target="_blank">see NASA’s previous logo - used for inspiration</a>).

<p>Twenty students from across the country have been selected for their dedication, passion, and unique contribution to advancing sustainable energy in America. The young leaders—five each in the categories of Technician, Innovator, Politico, and Storyteller—will meet for one week on August 11th, 2013 on Oregon’s Mt. Hood at the ReCharge! Retreat to explore an area of the country where energy is accelerating towards renewables.</p><p>Participants will hike Elliot Glacier, which has experienced 60 percent snowpack loss since 1982; tour the Boardman Coal Plant, scheduled to close by 2020; experience The Dalles Dam, located on the Columbia River and producing hydropower since 1957; and visit Biglow Canyon Wind Farm, which powers 125,000 homes in rural Oregon. Upon returning home, ReCharge! Delegates put what they learn at the retreat to use on their campus and in their communities by promoting sustainable energy solutions.</p>
<p>Fish is studying renewable energy technology and has been selected as a young leader in the Technician category. “We are delighted to have Cody from Lane Community College join us for the ReCharge! Retreat and share his technical expertise. Not only are we excited to support Cody’s leadership development, but are also glad to connect Focus the Nation to Lane Community College for the first time,” says Garett Brennan, Executive Director of Focus the Nation.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <br />Focus the Nation created ReCharge! in collaboration with The Center for Whole Communities to address the need for rising leaders to approach energy challenges with innovative ideas and fortitude throughout their careers. ReCharge! is made possible through sponsorship by Bonneville Power Administration, EDP Renewables, KEEN Footwear, and Portland General Electric.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Add <code>.form-inline</code> for left-aligned labels and inline-block controls for a compact layout.</p>
<form class="gantry-example form-inline"><input class="input-small" type="text" /> <input class="input-small" type="password" /> <label class="checkbox"> <input type="checkbox" /> Remember me </label> <button class="btn" type="submit">Sign in</button></form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;form class="form-inline"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" class="input-small" placeholder="Email"&gt;
  &lt;input type="password" class="input-small" placeholder="Password"&gt;
  &lt;label class="checkbox"&gt;
    &lt;input type="checkbox"&gt; Remember me
  &lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;button type="submit" class="btn"&gt;Sign in&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
<h3>Horizontal form</h3>
<p>Right align labels and float them to the left to make them appear on the same line as controls. Requires the most markup changes from a default form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>.form-horizontal</code> to the form</li>
<li>Wrap labels and controls in <code>.control-group</code></li>
<li>Add <code>.control-label</code> to the label</li>
<li>Wrap any associated controls in <code>.controls</code> for proper alignment</li>
</ul>
<form class="gantry-example form-horizontal"><fieldset class="hidden-tablet"><legend>Legend</legend>
<div class="control-group"><label class="control-label" for="inputEmail">Email</label>
<div class="controls"><input id="inputEmail" type="text" /></div>
</div>
<div class="control-group"><label class="control-label" for="inputPassword">Password</label>

    &lt;label class="control-label" for="inputEmail"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;div class="controls"&gt;
      &lt;input type="text" id="inputEmail" placeholder="Email"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="control-group"&gt;
    &lt;label class="control-label" for="inputPassword"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;div class="controls"&gt;
      &lt;input type="password" id="inputPassword" placeholder="Password"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="control-group"&gt;

      &lt;label class="checkbox"&gt;
        &lt;input type="checkbox"&gt; Remember me
      &lt;/label&gt;

<h2>Supported form controls</h2>
<p>Examples of standard form controls supported in an example form layout.</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<p>Most common form control, text-based input fields. Includes support for all HTML5 types: text, password, datetime, datetime-local, date, month, time, week, number, email, url, search, tel, and color.</p>
<p>Requires the use of a specified <code>type</code> at all times.</p>
<form class="gantry-example form-inline"><input type="text" /></form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;input type="text" placeholder="Text input"&gt;</pre>
<h3>Textarea</h3>
<p>Form control which supports multiple lines of text. Change <code>row</code> attribute as necessary.</p>
<form class="gantry-example form-inline"><textarea rows="3"></textarea></form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;textarea rows="3"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;</pre>
<h3>Checkboxes and radios</h3>
<p>Checkboxes are for selecting one or several options in a list while radios are for selecting one option from many.</p>
<h4>Default (stacked)</h4>
<form class="gantry-example"><label class="checkbox"> <input type="checkbox" value="" /> Option one is this and that—be sure to include why it''s great </label> <br /> <label class="radio"> <input id="optionsRadios1" type="radio" name="optionsRadios" value="option1" checked="checked" /> Option one is this and that—be sure to include why it''s great </label> <label class="radio"> <input id="optionsRadios2" type="radio" name="optionsRadios" value="option2" /> Option two can be something else and selecting it will deselect option one </label></form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;label class="checkbox"&gt;
  &lt;input type="checkbox" value=""&gt;
  Option one is this and that—be sure to include why it''s great
&lt;/label&gt;

&lt;label class="radio"&gt;
  &lt;input type="radio" name="optionsRadios" id="optionsRadios1" value="option1" checked&gt;
  Option one is this and that—be sure to include why it''s great
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;label class="radio"&gt;
  &lt;input type="radio" name="optionsRadios" id="optionsRadios2" value="option2"&gt;
  Option two can be something else and selecting it will deselect option one
&lt;/label&gt;</pre>
<h4>Inline checkboxes</h4>
<p>Add the <code>.inline</code> class to a series of checkboxes or radios for controls appear on the same line.</p>
<form class="gantry-example"><label class="checkbox inline"> <input id="inlineCheckbox1" type="checkbox" value="option1" /> 1 </label> <label class="checkbox inline"> <input id="inlineCheckbox2" type="checkbox" value="option2" /> 2 </label> <label class="checkbox inline"> <input id="inlineCheckbox3" type="checkbox" value="option3" /> 3 </label></form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;label class="checkbox inline"&gt;
  &lt;input type="checkbox" id="inlineCheckbox1" value="option1"&gt; 1
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;label class="checkbox inline"&gt;
  &lt;input type="checkbox" id="inlineCheckbox2" value="option2"&gt; 2
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;label class="checkbox inline"&gt;
  &lt;input type="checkbox" id="inlineCheckbox3" value="option3"&gt; 3
&lt;/label&gt;</pre>
<h3>Selects</h3>
<p>Use the default option or specify a <code>multiple="multiple"</code> to show multiple options at once.</p>
<form class="gantry-example"><select><option>1</option><option>2</option><option>3</option><option>4</option><option>5</option></select><br /><select multiple="multiple"><option>1</option><option>2</option><option>3</option><option>4</option><option>5</option></select></form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;select&gt;
  &lt;option&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;

&lt;select multiple="multiple"&gt;
  &lt;option&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;

<h2>Extending form controls</h2>
<p>Adding on top of existing browser controls, Bootstrap includes other useful form components.</p>
<h3>Prepended and appended inputs</h3>
<p><span>Add text or buttons before or after any text-based input. Do note that <code>select</code> elements are not supported here.</span></p>
<div class="gantry-width-block gantry-width-50">
<div class="gantry-left" style="float: none;">
<h4>Default options</h4>
<p>Wrap an <code>.add-on</code> and an <code>input</code> with one of two classes to prepend or append text to an input.</p>
<form class="gantry-example">
<div class="input-prepend"><span class="add-on">@</span> <input id="prependedInput" class="span2" type="text" size="16" /></div>
<br />
<div class="input-append"><input id="appendedInput" class="span2" type="text" size="16" /> <span class="add-on">.00</span></div>
</form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;div class="input-prepend"&gt;
  &lt;span class="add-on"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;input class="span2" id="prependedInput" size="16" type="text" placeholder="Username"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="input-append"&gt;
  &lt;input class="span2" id="appendedInput" size="16" type="text"&gt;&lt;span class="add-on"&gt;.00&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<h4>Search form</h4>
<form class="gantry-example form-search">
<div class="input-append"><input class="span2 search-query" type="text" /> <button class="btn" type="submit">Search</button></div>
<br /><br />
<div class="input-prepend"><button class="btn" type="submit">Search</button> <input class="span2 search-query" type="text" /></div>
</form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;form class="form-search"&gt;
  &lt;div class="input-append"&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" class="span2 search-query"&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit" class="btn"&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="input-prepend"&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit" class="btn"&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" class="span2 search-query"&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="gantry-width-block gantry-width-50">
<div class="gantry-right" style="float: none;">
<h4>Combined</h4>
<p>Use both classes and two instances of <code>.add-on</code> to prepend and append an input.</p>
<form class="gantry-example form-inline">
<div class="input-prepend input-append"><span class="add-on">$</span> <input id="appendedPrependedInput" class="span2" type="text" size="16" /> <span class="add-on">.00</span></div>
</form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;div class="input-prepend input-append"&gt;
  &lt;span class="add-on"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;input class="span2" id="appendedPrependedInput" size="16" type="text"&gt;&lt;span class="add-on"&gt;.00&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<h4>Buttons instead of text</h4>
<p>Instead of a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with text, use a <code>.btn</code> to attach a button (or two) to an input.</p>
<form class="gantry-example">
<div class="input-append"><input id="appendedInputButton" class="span2" type="text" size="16" /> <button class="btn" type="button">Go!</button></div>
<br />
<div class="input-append"><input id="appendedInputButtons" class="span2" type="text" size="16" /> <button class="btn" type="button">Search</button> <button class="btn" type="button">Options</button></div>
</form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;div class="input-append"&gt;
  &lt;input class="span2" id="appendedInputButton" size="16" type="text"&gt;&lt;button class="btn" type="button"&gt;Go!&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="input-append"&gt;
  &lt;input class="span2" id="appendedInputButtons" size="16" type="text"&gt;&lt;button class="btn" type="button"&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button class="btn" type="button"&gt;Options&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="gantry-width-block gantry-width-50">
<div class="gantry-left">
<h3>Form actions</h3>
<p>End a form with a group of actions (buttons). When placed within a <code>.form-horizontal</code>, the buttons will automatically indent to line up with the form controls.</p>
<form class="gantry-example">
<div class="form-actions"><button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">Save changes</button> <button class="btn" type="button">Cancel</button></div>
</form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;div class="form-actions"&gt;
  &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Save changes&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button type="button" class="btn"&gt;Cancel&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<h3>Help text</h3>
<p>Inline and block level support for help text that appears around form controls.</p>
<h4>Inline help</h4>
<form class="gantry-example form-inline"><input type="text" /> <span class="help-inline">Inline help text</span></form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;input type="text"&gt;&lt;span class="help-inline"&gt;Inline help text&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
<h4>Block help</h4>
<form class="gantry-example form-inline"><input type="text" /> <span class="help-block">A longer block of help text that breaks onto a new line and may extend beyond one line.</span></form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;input type="text"&gt;&lt;span class="help-block"&gt;A longer block of help text that breaks onto a new line and may extend beyond one line.&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="gantry-width-block gantry-width-50">
<div class="gantry-right" style="float: none;">
<h3>Control sizing</h3>
<p>Use relative sizing classes like <code>.input-large</code> or match your inputs to the grid column sizes using <code>.span*</code> classes.</p>
<h4>Relative sizing</h4>
<form class="gantry-example" style="padding-bottom: 15px;">
<div class="controls docs-input-sizes"><input class="input-mini" type="text" /><br /> <input class="input-small" type="text" /><br /> <input class="input-medium" type="text" /><br /> <input class="input-large" type="text" /><br /> <input class="input-xlarge" type="text" /><br /> <input class="input-xxlarge" type="text" /></div>
</form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;input class="input-mini" type="text" placeholder=".input-mini"&gt;
&lt;input class="input-small" type="text" placeholder=".input-small"&gt;
&lt;input class="input-medium" type="text" placeholder=".input-medium"&gt;
&lt;input class="input-large" type="text" placeholder=".input-large"&gt;
&lt;input class="input-xlarge" type="text" placeholder=".input-xlarge"&gt;
&lt;input class="input-xxlarge" type="text" placeholder=".input-xxlarge"&gt;</pre>
<br />
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In future versions, we''ll be altering the use of these relative input classes to match our button sizes. For example, <code>.input-large</code> will increase the padding and font-size of an input.</p>
<h3>Uneditable inputs</h3>
<p>Present data in a form that''s not editable without using actual form markup.</p>
<form class="gantry-example"><span class="input-xlarge uneditable-input">Some value here</span></form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;span class="input-xlarge uneditable-input"&gt;Some value here&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Form control states</h2>
<p>Provide feedback to users or visitors with basic feedback states on form controls and labels.</p>
<div class="gantry-width-block gantry-width-50">
<div class="gantry-left">
<h3>Input focus</h3>
<p>We remove the default <code>outline</code> styles on some form controls and apply a <code>box-shadow</code> in its place for <code>:focus</code>.</p>
<form class="gantry-example form-inline"><input id="focusedInput" class="input-xlarge focused" type="text" value="This is focused..." /></form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;input class="input-xlarge" id="focusedInput" type="text" value="This is focused..."&gt;</pre>

<h3>Validation states</h3>

<h1>Buttons</h1>
</div>
<h2>Default buttons</h2>
<p>Button styles can be applied to anything with the <code>.btn</code> class applied. However, typically you''ll want to apply these to only <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements for the best rendering.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
<thead>
<tr><th>Button</th><th>class=""</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><button class="btn" type="button">Default</button></td>
<td><code>btn</code></td>
<td>Standard gray button with gradient</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><button class="btn btn-primary" type="button">Primary</button></td>
<td><code>btn btn-primary</code></td>
<td>Provides extra visual weight and identifies the primary action in a set of buttons</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Cross browser compatibility</h4>
<p>IE9 doesn''t crop background gradients on rounded corners, so we remove it. Related, IE9 jankifies disabled <code>button</code> elements, rendering text gray with a nasty text-shadow that we cannot fix.</p>
<h2>Button sizes</h2>
<p>Fancy larger or smaller buttons? Add <code>.btn-large</code>, <code>.btn-small</code>, or <code>.btn-mini</code> for additional sizes.</p>
<div class="gantry-example">
<p><button class="btn btn-large btn-primary" type="button">Large button</button> <button class="btn btn-large" type="button">Large button</button></p>
<p><button class="btn btn-primary" type="button">Default button</button> <button class="btn" type="button">Default button</button></p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;button class="btn btn-large btn-primary" type="button"&gt;Large button&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button class="btn btn-large" type="button"&gt;Large button&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;button class="btn btn-primary" type="button"&gt;Default button&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button class="btn" type="button"&gt;Default button&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;button class="btn btn-small btn-primary" type="button"&gt;Small button&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button class="btn btn-small" type="button"&gt;Small button&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;button class="btn btn-mini btn-primary" type="button"&gt;Mini button&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button class="btn btn-mini" type="button"&gt;Mini button&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<p>Create block level buttons—those that span the full width of a parent— by adding <code>.btn-block</code>.</p>
<div class="gantry-example">
<div class="well" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto 10px;"><button class="btn btn-large btn-block btn-primary" type="button">Block level button</button> <button class="btn btn-large btn-block" type="button">Block level button</button></div>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;button class="btn btn-large btn-block btn-primary" type="button"&gt;Block level button&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button class="btn btn-large btn-block" type="button"&gt;Block level button&lt;/button&gt;</pre>
<h2>Disabled state</h2>
<p>Make buttons look unclickable by fading them back 50%.</p>
<div class="gantry-width-block gantry-width-50">
<div class="gantry-left">
<h3>Anchor element</h3>
<p>Add the <code>.disabled</code> class to <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> buttons.</p>
<p class="gantry-example"><a class="btn btn-large btn-primary disabled" href="#">Primary link</a> <a class="btn btn-large disabled" href="#">Link</a></p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;a href="#" class="btn btn-large btn-primary disabled"&gt;Primary link&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="#" class="btn btn-large disabled"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<br />
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We use <code>.disabled</code> as a utility class here, similar to the common <code>.active</code> class, so no prefix is required.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="gantry-width-block gantry-width-50">
<div class="gantry-right">
<h3>Button element</h3>
<p>Add the <code>disabled</code> attribute to <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> buttons.</p>
<p class="gantry-example"><button class="btn btn-large btn-primary disabled" type="button" disabled="disabled">Primary button</button> <button class="btn btn-large" type="button" disabled="disabled">Button</button></p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;button type="button" class="btn btn-large btn-primary disabled" disabled="disabled"&gt;Primary button&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button type="button" class="btn btn-large" disabled&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>One class, multiple tags</h2>
<p>Use the <code>.btn</code> class on an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element.</p>
<form class="gantry-example"><a class="btn" href="http://nweei.org/demo/">Link</a> <button class="btn" type="submit">Button</button> <input class="btn" type="button" value="Input" /> <input class="btn" type="submit" value="Submit" /></form>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;a class="btn" href=""&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;button class="btn" type="submit"&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;input class="btn" type="button" value="Input"&gt;
&lt;input class="btn" type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a best practice, try to match the element for your context to ensure matching cross-browser rendering. If you have an <code>input</code>, use an <code>&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</code> for your button.</p>

<p>ASHRAE is an acronym which stands for the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). The building discipline that ASHRE serves is the Mechanical Engineer (ME) who is the building design professional that is concerned with building occupant comfort.</p><p>Consequently, mechanical engineers need to know all about the building like, the number of occupants and what they''ll be doing in the building, (sitting doing office work, dancing the tango, doing brain surgery).</p>
<p>All of these are called "end-use" and have a significant impact on the comfort systems and closely related - energy consumption. MEs need to know the kind of and quantity of light being used in a building because lighting produces along with light, heat, which contributes to the "cooling load" of the building. Cooling loads need to be offset with air conditioning which is designed by the ME. The ME needs information about the building construction materials, type and color of the carpeting, color of the walls, materials used for in the furnishings, operating hours, occupancy profiles (when most of the occupants are in the building). All of these things add to the understanding of the building that the ME uses to design the comfort systems.</p>
<p>All of that to tell you that ASHRAE is very serious about doing this comfort system design stuff right and therefore, spends a lot of time figuring out things like the absolute insulation value of the (Pink Panther) fiberglass insulation used in most residential construction walls, ceilings, and floors. Fundamental information is found in the ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook which is one of four volumes that is updated once every four years. Joining ASHRAE gets you a new volume every year which is updated through research done by ASHRAE technical committees. ASHRE has a student membership rate.</p>

<p>ACEEE’s thorough and peer-reviewed technical work is widely relied on by policymakers, business and industry decision-makers, consumers, media, and other energy professionals. Recently, ACEEE''s efforts have clearly identified what is becoming know as, ''the energy-water nexus". In simple terms, every drop of water saved in the U.S. saves energy, and every unit of energy saved saves water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the past 30 years, strategies to conserve energy and increase the efficiency of energy use have been widely pursued. Similar efforts in the conservation and efficient use of water have occurred over the past 20-plus years. However, the two communities have historically not worked together in a coherent, collaborative manner, and instead generally created separate but parallel efforts. These separate activities could realize significant benefits from coordination.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">At a time when human and natural systems are colliding with increasingly disastrous results, thousands of students, from Bellingham to Albuquerque, Los Angeles to Missoula, are turning to academic programs focused on building communities that protect — rather than degrade — the planet, while encouraging prosperity and social justice. They are cutting waste, producing healthy local food, designing energy-generating buildings and reducing consumption of fuels and other resources. Between study and class time, many also participate in clubs, organize educational and local events, and work to green their campuses. Here, we’ve collected some of the West’s most innovative programs. Our list is far from comprehensive, but it shows the range of opportunities for scholars hoping to reshape society for the sake of future generations.</p>
<h3>OREGON</h3>
<p>Sustainability is a core value of the strategic plan at Lane Community College (lanecc.edu/sustainability) in Eugene, Ore. The college’s Institute for Sustainable Practices administers two-year degrees in fields like energy management and water conservation technology. And the college has ambitious campus sustainability initiatives, including LEED gold or platinum certification for new buildings, low-water landscaping certified as wildlife hab- itat by the National Wildlife Federation, and a program that gives prizes to campus administrative and academic offices that meet waste-reduction and energy-saving goals. Lane Community College also has a student-run Learning Garden that supplies produce for the campus and hosts an annual apple cider-pressing party.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><em>Washington, D.C.</em>—A new study&nbsp;by ACEEE&nbsp;outlines how energy efficiency could be used in an upcoming standard by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reduce CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;levels with no net cost to the economy. The standard, currently under review by the White House Office of Management and Budget and likely to be released in early June, would set a CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions limit for existing power plants under Section 111(d) of the <em>Clean Air Act</em>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">The study shows how the Environmental Protection Agency could use four common energy efficiency policies to set a carbon pollution standard that reduces emissions to 26% below 2012 levels. In 2030, these policies would save 600 million tons of <a href="http://www.aceee.org/glossary/9#term622" class="glossary-term"><acronym title="Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are often called greenhouse gases. Some, like carbon dioxide, occur naturally and are emitted through both natural processes and human activities, but other greenhouse gases (e.g., fluorinated gases) are created and emitted solely through human activities. The principal greenhouse gases that enter the atmosphere because of human activities are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases.">greenhouse gas</acronym></a>&nbsp;emissions, save over 925 million <a href="http://www.aceee.org/glossary/9#term597" class="glossary-term"><acronym title="Megawatt-hour: Equivalent to 1000 kWh (kilowatt-hours), or 1,000,000 Wh (watt-hours), of energy.">MWh</acronym></a>&nbsp;of electricity, reduce electricity demand by 25%, and avoid the need for 494 power plants.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">“If the Environmental Protection Agency is looking for a way to cheaply cut carbon pollution and boost the economy while giving states the freedom to use their energy resources, energy efficiency is the answer,” said ACEEE executive director Steven Nadel.</p>

Ebbage visited Suffolk as preparations are underway to program curricula and classes for Suffolk’s new building that will be the first of its kind in the state community college system. Ebbage’s visit was paid for by the American Association of Community Colleges.<br /> <br /> "The College''s approach is far-reaching and will set Suffolk County apart from others in the state," McKay said and added that the center would help meet "the workforce needs of area businesses by increasing the pool of workers that are skilled in renewable energy systems and energy management, among other professions.”<br /> <br /> The new facility will house laboratories and classrooms to teach installation, maintenance and repair of solar, photovoltaic, wind, geothermal and other green power technologies, according to Suffolk County Community College President Dr. Shaun L. McKay who said plans call for the building to be solar-powered with geothermal heating and would contain a prototype solar house on rails that could be used indoors or rolled outside to test various renewable energy materials.<br /> <br /> Construction on the new building will commence when anticipated corrective state legislation is passed reinstating state&nbsp;funding&nbsp;that was inadvertently left out of the New York State budget.&nbsp;</p>

The article explains show Lane has used its Greenpower grants form EWEB to support energy efficiency and other sustainability on campus.</em></p>
<h2>Lane Community College Embodies Sustainability</h2>
<p>Original article Link: <a href="http://www.eweb.org/bc/march2015/lcc">http://www.eweb.org/bc/march2015/lcc</a></p>
<p><img style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; float: left;" src="images/stories/bc_LCC.jpg" alt="bc LCC" width="200" height="133" />Since Lane Community College''s founding 1964, the college has emerged over the past five decades as a leader in innovation in both its operations and its curriculum, including efforts to use energy wisely and sustainably. So when the Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board offered a <a href="http://www.eweb.org/greenpower" id="energyLink">renewable energy program</a>, it made good sense for the college to support the program.</p>
<p>"EWEB''s Greenpower program aligns perfectly with the college''s core values," said Anna Scott, Lane''s energy analyst. "The college now pledges 12% of its energy use to EWEB Greenpower."</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenpower grants support energy innovation</p>
<p>In addition to allocating a portion of its energy use to EWEB Greenpower, the college has received two Greenpower grants that funded energy innovations on Lane''s main and downtown campuses.</p>
<p>The first grant was issued in 2009 for a solar station on Lane''s main campus that offers charging for as many as 19 electric vehicles at once. The campus fleet, students, employees and community members use the station. The 36-kilowatt photovoltaic roof array covering the station feeds power to the main campus electric grid, and students were trained on solar electric installation as part of the project.</p>
<p>EWEB awarded the second Greenpower grant to Lane in 2011 for the college''s 12-kilovolt photovoltaic roof array at the downtown campus. That system offsets the building''s energy usage with renewable solar power, and serves as a functional renewable energy educational opportunity. Lane''s Renewable Energy Technician students are able to monitor the energy production, compare the performance of the different types of panels and learn about maintenance of the system.</p>
<p>"These projects have improved Lane’s bottom line, furthered college goals, and most importantly, the projects have doubled as hands-on learning opportunities for students in the college''s energy management and other sustainability programs," Scott said.</p>
<p>Through support of EWEB Greenpower, the college has earned points towards <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/LEED" target="blank" id="energyLink">LEED</a> Platinum and Gold certification for its downtown location. Lane''s core value of sustainability underscores its commitment to practices such as efficient energy systems, pursuing LEED certification for new and remodeled buildings, green events, recycling, composting, use of eco-friendly cleaning supplies, supporting four sustainability related degree programs, and an organic learning garden.</p>
<p>More information about Lane''s sustainability efforts is available on the <a href="http://www.eweb.org/greenpower" target="blank" id="energyLink">college''s website</a>.</p>','2015-03-03 18:29:36',NULL,17,1,'2015-03-03 18:29:36',0,5238);

The prospect of employment in the water conservation industry couldn''t be better so maybe the main issue regarding our low enrollment is a lack of understanding by folks who are interested in a new occupation - expecially one that helps to save the human race - of the severity of the planet''s water situation. To that end, we have found that Katie Curic has done some good reporting, in a simplified way, to explain our water issues and potential solutions. (Note, we are not big fans of Desalinization. The energy and evvionmental costs are too huge! RE)</p>

<p>On Tuesday night, the U.S. House of Representatives included a five-year extension of the solar investment tax credit (ITC) in an <a href="http://appropriations.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=394337" target="_blank" rel="external"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">omnibus bill</span></a> that will likely be finalized and taken up by the full House by the end of this week.</p>
<p>The implications of this development could be huge for the U.S. solar market, which was staring down a sunset of the wildly successful ITC at the end of 2016. The 30% tax credit has been instrumental in driving growth in the solar industry, and stakeholders have been fearful of what might happen to the market if the ITC is allowed to lapse next year.</p>
<p>The path of the $1.15 trillion omnibus spending bill is uncertain, but some observers contend that there is reason to be optimistic.</p>

<p>​NEW ORLEANS — New buildings at community colleges provide fertile ground for campuses to not only integrate technology to save energy and money,&nbsp;they also provide hands-on learning experiences for students and instructors.</p>
<p>“Everyone is building now to LEED-standard buildings,” said Roger Ebbage, director of energy management and water conservation at <a href="https://www.lanecc.edu/">Lane Community College</a>’s (LCC) <a href="https://www.lanecc.edu/sustainability">Institute for Sustainable Practices</a>.</p>
<p>The Oregon college’s institute — dubbed the “building that teaches” —&nbsp; provides the latest in technology, from natural ventilation to solar water heating, and it also allows for students and staff to test&nbsp;systems for&nbsp;efficiency. For example, the Institute for&nbsp;Sustainable Practices has multiple heating and cooling systems. Students can experiment to find the best combinations&nbsp;that produce&nbsp;the lowest carbon emissions and lowest utility costs.</p>

Over the next 3 years, the $618,881 grant will focus on providing community college students with opportunities to learn about energy management through online classes, developing hands on skills with “real world” field projects and cultivating potential employment connections with Northwest public utilities mentors.</p>
<p>iLEED introduces a new method of career technical educational content delivery which enables energy efficiency education to be available for a wider population geographicly. It produces highly-qualified energy management technicians to our region’s commercial building sector and provides access to high-wage, high-skill jobs to students in rural areas, or students who are not able to attend “traditional” classes.</p><p>With this model of higher education / industry partnership, energy management students will be served regardless of their geographic location, work-schedule, or family obligations. This opens opportunities to student demographics that are currently unavailable in current classes and absent within the energy industry.</p>
<p>iLEED is more then just generating online courses and or an online degree option. The program is piloting a methodology for non-centrally located remote students to be able to accomplish technical hands on activities. These activities are guided by industry experts who can facilitate access to tools, mechanical equipment and/or tactile experiences. Additionally, they provide an invaluable direct student-to-industry connection that cultivates immersion into the industry along with potential employment opportunities.</p>
<p>The program is motivated by:</p>
<ol>
<li>The high demand for energy management workforce by industry</li>
<li>The need for a novel education method which will expand technical education to a broader student population,</li>
<li>Lane Community College’s expertise in energy management programs and experience delivering quality programs outside of the traditional campus environment.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"This is not just taking a program online, rather, we have the potential to revolutionize how career technical programs serve underserved populations. Utilizing proven online instructional methods and innovative partnerships, we expect to increase the Energy Management program’s enrollment and consequently that of Lane Community College."</em></p>
<p><em>– Energy/Water Education Programs Coordinator, Roger Ebbage.</em></p>

<p><em>"The hands-on demonstrations for logging and energy auditing were essential to giving me the confidence to doing the same when getting back to my own facility"</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Hi Roger,</p>
<p>I participated in the EMC program through NWEEI in 2011 and highly recommend the experience for those interested in energy and resource management. I was particularly impressed by the presenters’ willingness to discuss individual scenarios and facilities with participants. We had such a great range of building types and uses represented by the participants (everything from scientific research facilities to schools) which helped take the theoretical we were learning about and make it applicable to our own current jobs. The hands-on demonstrations for logging and energy auditing were essential to giving me the confidence to doing the same when getting back to my own facility. I loved being able to physically tour to see the practical applications and equipment we were learning about - and the mix of presentation and tours kept the days moving quickly.</p>
<p>My employer certainly appreciated the requirement to implement an energy saving project, making the certification well worth the time and dollars. And several years later I’m still working towards accomplishing the very long list of projects and monitoring steps that were inspired by this program!</p>
<p>Best!</p>

<p><img class="rt-image" style="margin: 10px; float: right;" src="images/stories/siemens-pr-photo.jpg" alt="people sitting around table" />EUGENE, Ore. — Lane Community College is working with Siemens, one of the world’s largest engineering companies, in support of its Energy Management Program. The program includes a building automation systems option, which helps better prepare students for careers in the building technologies industry.</p>
<p>Siemens has a significant need for qualified building technologies personnel and is working with Lane to create a process of identifying students with a knowledge of building controls for possible positions in its Oregon offices.</p>
<p>Entire article: <a href="images/pdf_files/nr2040-Newsroom-LaneCC.pdf" target="_blank"><img class="wf_file_icon" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle;" src="media/jce/icons/pdf.png" alt="pdf" /><span class="wf_file_text">nr2040-Newsroom-LaneCC.pdf</span></a><br />Original article Link: <a href="https://www.lanecc.edu/newsroom/n/nr2040" target="_blank">https://www.lanecc.edu/newsroom/n/nr2040</a></p><p>“We’re planning to have students intern with Siemens in the summer between their first and second years in the program,” said Roger Ebbage, Lane Energy Management Program director. “This provides real-world experience for the student and gives Siemens an opportunity to evaluate them in advance of a potential full-time position.”</p>
<p>The program’s recently added Building Controls Option is a rigorous two-year associate of applied science degree that trains building controls technicians, a highly coveted and in-demand set of workers who manage automated systems in commercial buildings.</p>
<p>Ebbage attributes part of Siemens’ interest in his program to the limited number of energy management programs - especially those with a building controls option - throughout the United States.</p>
<p>“Lane has one of the only commercial energy efficiency programs in the country,” said Ebbage. “We have grown and specialized to meet today’s energy management needs, resulting in high demand for our graduates.”</p>
<p>Nationally, Siemens’ Building Technologies Division has many technical positions currently available as a result of business growth and normal attrition. Therefore, qualified candidates are in high demand. Joe Levesque, an energy engineer with Siemens Energy Management in Eugene, can vouch for the program’s quality - it landed him his current job.</p>
<p>“I returned to college after a varied career path specifically to obtain a degree from the Lane Energy Management Program,” said Levesque. “Siemens sees the degree’s focus on building automation controls and commercial energy efficiency as a combination of skills that are very rare and increasingly in demand throughout the industry.”<br /> For more information about Lane’s Energy Management Program, visit online at: <a href="https://www.lanecc.edu/sustainability/energy-management-program"> </a><a href="https://www.lanecc.edu/sustainability/energy-management-program">https://www.lanecc.edu/sustainability/energy-management-program</a></p>

<p><span class="wf_caption" style="margin: 10px; float: right; display: block; max-width: 166px; width: 100%;"><img src="images/stories/nsf1.gif" alt="nsf1" width="166" height="200" class="rt-image" style="margin-top: auto; margin-bottom: auto; width: 100%; float: right;" /><span style="text-align: center; padding: 5px; display: block;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span></span></span></p>
<p>It supplies highly-qualified energy management technicians to our region’s commercial building sector and provides access to high-wage, high-skill jobs to students in rural areas, or students who are not able to attend “traditional” classes. With this model of higher education/ industry partnership, energy management students will be served regardless of their geographic location, work schedule, or family obligations. This opens opportunities to student demographics that are currently unavailable in current classes and absent within the energy industry.</p>
<p><strong>iLEED is more than just generating online courses and or an online degree option.</strong></p>
<p>The program is piloting a methodology for non-centrally located remote students to be able to accomplish technical hands-on activities. These activities are guided by industry experts who can facilitate access to tools, mechanical equipment and or tactile experiences. Additionally, they provide an invaluable direct student-to-industry connection that cultivates immersion into the industry along with potential employment opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>The program is motivated by:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The high demand for energy management workforce by industry</li>
<li>The need for a novel education method which will expand technical education to broader student populations,</li>
<li>Lane Community College’s expertise in energy management programs and experience delivering quality programs outside the traditional campus environment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is not just taking a program online, rather, we have the potential to revolutionize how career technical programs serve underserved populations. Utilizing proven online instructional methods and innovative partnerships, we expect to increase the Energy Management program’s enrollment and consequently that of Lane Community College."</p>
<cite title="">Energy/Water Education Programs Coordinator, Roger Ebbage.</cite></blockquote>
<p>The iLEED grant was awarded on July 1, 2016 and is funded for three years. It is currently in its 4th year on a no-cost extension.&nbsp;</p>','2017-04-05 23:28:41',NULL,50,1,'2017-04-05 23:28:41',0,3223);

<h2>We’re seeking individuals who are able to demonstrate job tasks related to commercial energy efficiency and water conservation.</h2>
<p><a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22529:what-is-ileed&amp;catid=66&amp;Itemid=526">Through a National Science Foundation Advanced Technology Education grant</a>, Lane Community College is expanding energy efficiency and water conservation educational opportunities to students across the Western United States. Online degrees are fairly commonplace in many sectors of higher education but career- technical education (CTE) lags behind, in large part due to the hands-on fieldwork requirements of CTE type programs. Together, we can overcome that obstacle by establishing a network of utility fieldwork mentors who can provide essential energy or water-related field experiences.</p>
<p>Although students will be getting the majority of their training hours through online classes, it is imperative that we connect “book smarts” to real-life experiences. That’s where a utilities’ expertise and industry connections can provide huge value to any educational training.</p>

<p><em>Editor’s note: <a href="https://www.aacc.nche.edu/programs/mentorlinks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MentorLinks</a> mentees began planning their two-year projects with mentors at a two-day meeting in Washington, D.C., in October. The <a href="http://www.aacc.nche.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Association of Community Colleges </a>(AACC) convened the meeting and awarded grants to the selected colleges with support from the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Science Foundation</a>’s <a href="https://www.aacc.nche.edu/programs/advanced-technological-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Technological Education</a> (ATE) program.</em></p>
<p>Their projects involve various STEM disciplines, but all 11 of the new MentorLinks colleges share similar challenges with recruiting and retaining students until they complete credentials.</p>
<p>During a meeting wrap-up last month, the mentees said they were excited to learn from their assigned mentors as well as connect with the other mentors and mentee teams.</p>
<p>“Transformation only comes if you make yourself vulnerable,” said Gail Marie Alexander, who teaches environmental technologies and sustainable practices at <a href="http://www.cascadia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cascadia College</a> in Washington. She explained that her first long, candid conversation with mentor Roger Ebbage helped her focus on her students’ potential jobs and the professional certifications that will enhance their career prospects.</p>
<p>MentorLinks is an AACC program that helps two-year colleges start or improve technician education programs. AACC has received funding since 1999 from ATE for the program that previous participants see as key to launching intended projects and helpful for instigating broader changes.</p>
<p>In addition to significant enrollment gains, MentorLinks alumni accomplishments include developing 140 new courses, 21 new associate degrees and 30 new certificates; establishing internships; enhancing industry partnerships; and leveraging their projects to obtain more than $4.5 million in additional grant funding.</p>
<h3>The program structure</h3>
<p>The MentorLinks college teams, which are selected through AACC’s competitive process, receive two years of mentoring from a community college, subject-matter expert; technical assistance from AACC; $20,000 grants for professional development and release time for curriculum development; and travel support through October 2019.</p>
<p>The one faculty member and one administrator on each of the 11 selected colleges’ teams are now preparing for their mentors’ visits to their campuses. Next year, the teams will have “reverse site visits” when each teams visits their mentor’s college or other community colleges, which have programs similar to ones they hope to launch.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The new MentorLinks cohort first met their mentors and conferred with them in October during a two-day workshop in Washington, D.C. After, the MentorLinks teams attended the <a href="https://www.aacc.nche.edu/programs/advanced-technological-education/ate-conference-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ATE Principal Investigators Conference</a>. Approximately 850 people participated in the 2017 conference where ATE principal investigators and their industry partners shared information about their innovative technician education initiatives. The conference is also a networking opportunity where ATE principal investigators have developed collaborative approaches to the challenges of preparing highly skilled technicians for advanced technology fields of strategic importance to the nation.</p>

<h3>Focused on cybersecurity</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.daytonastate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daytona State College</a> in Florida wants to identify the most effective ways to help current and new IT and cybersecurity students complete required course sequences efficiently in four existing degree programs. It is considering using a cohort model to improve recruitment, retention and completion.</p>
<p>The Daytona State team plans to use geospatial data provided by its mentor <a href="http://www.geotechcenter.org/director.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincent DiNoto, Jr.</a>, to develop recruitment and retention strategies tailored for particular populations. DiNoto, principal investigator of the <a href="http://www.geotechcenter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence</a> (GeoTech), created geospatial data packets for all 11 MentorLinks colleges.</p>
<p>At the MentorLinks meeting, DiNoto presented information about how to use U.S. Census data maps to improve STEM program outcomes with various populations. He explained that <a href="https://jefferson.kctcs.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jefferson Community and Technical College</a>, which hosts the GeoTech Center, has improved the performance of underrepresented populations in gateway courses since providing city bus passes to all students. It began this program after GeoTech data identified a correlation between lower prerequisite course completions and public transportation usage. A survey of the student bus riders then found that not having money for bus fares affected their class attendance.</p>

INSERT IGNORE INTO Articles VALUES (231,'Student Highlight','<p>My name is Mia Hocking and I am a current LCC student enrolled in online Energy Management courses. I have worked for the Hillsboro School District since January 2010. In July 2018, I started a new position with the district as Resource Conservation Manager. This RCM position has experienced some turnover and I was looking for a creative challenge. Be careful what you ask for J It’s an amazing opportunity to do good things; save money, save resources, the collaboration between departments, develop programs and policies, engage our youth, and the list goes on. Even with all my ideas and desire to achieve, I realized that I really needed professional development in this new career. My research for education in this field led me to Roger Ebbage and that is how I found the Online Energy Management program at LCC.</p>
<p>I live and work in Hillsboro, OR so this is a major factor in my decision to enroll in this LCC program. I have not found similar programs or opportunities close to home. I also appreciate that I can complete the coursework around my daily work schedule. The district maintenance department has been understaffed for years and increasingly difficult to find skilled tradesmen interested in working for HSD. Given these circumstances, I felt that I needed resources that allowed me the opportunity to apply coursework to my daily tasks. I can say, without hesitation that LCC’s Online Energy Program and my instructors have provided applicable and accessible knowledge and training that continues to enhance my professional development.</p>
<p>Initially considering a commitment to a 2-year program and learning a new job seemed like a huge undertaking. It has been. However, I have only felt support and encouragement from both instructors, mentor, and my district. Considering that I have had to learn how to do my job without internal guidance, I am grateful to have made so many industry connections. I have much to learn yet, but I feel much more confident than if I had not enrolled in this program.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations to Esteban Montero Chacon!!!</strong> Esteban has received one of the American Public Power Association’s DEED scholarships to assist in his Energy Management program studies.</p>
<p>Esteban came to understand that in order to preserve our way of life on this planet, we need to do more than just recycle. So a few years ago, he decided to leave his formal work as a medical interpreter and dedicate his time to a new and more meaningful career path where he could use his technical skills and talents to make a greater difference in the world. Esteban enrolled in the Energy Management Program at Lane Community College in 2018 and, while continuing to work part-time, he has managed to excel in his courses and will graduate later this year with a high GPA.</p>
<p>Esteban’s bicultural background, international travel, and work experience give him a unique perspective and understanding of the world. He remains passionate and committed to helping create innovative and effective solutions to the ecological perils facing our world so that our planet can sustain healthy and happy human populations for many years to come.</p>
<p>Esteban''s family has been supportive and excited about this new career</p>
<p><img src="images/stories/images/Esteban_family.jpg" alt="Esteban family" width="233" height="302" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;" /></p>
<p>The Energy Management Program is very excited to have Esteban onboard and very proud of his success. In addition to the scholarship support, Esteban is working with Emerald People’s Utility District (EPUD) in Eugene, Oregon.</p>
<p>As a recipient of the DEED scholarship, Esteban works with EPUD, his sponsoring utility. This is a wonderful opportunity to connect with professionals and to learn firsthand about the industry. Below are some of the ways that the utility and the scholarship work for the student:</p>
<ul>
<li>The utility provides an opportunity for the student to shadow an employee on staff.</li>
<li>The utility shares information about the electric utility industry and career opportunities in public power with the recipient, such as by conducting a tour and briefing at the sponsor’s utility.</li>
<li>The utility offers the recipient an opportunity to assist and participate in special events the utility hosts, such as programs during Public Power Week or at local schools.</li>
<li>The utility provides a mentor to the scholarship recipient who can share information on appropriate public power career paths and be a resource to the student at least during the time frame of the&nbsp;DEED&nbsp;scholarship.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Energy Management program is very proud of its students and of the work that our utility partners play in the education of students.</p>
<p>If you are interested in applying for the $2,000 DEED educational scholarship, visit <a href="https://www.publicpower.org/deed-funding-students">publicpower.org/deed-funding-students</a> to ensure you meet the eligibility criteria. The application period opens August 1, 2021, and applications are due by October 15, 2020.</p>
<p>Now is the time to apply to the program and get started! The American Public Power Association can assist you in finding a DEED member utility to sponsor your application, but don’t delay. You must have an assigned sponsoring utility at least two weeks prior to the application deadline in order to apply.</p>

<p>No matter where your building is located or what it is used for, there’s one powerful tool that will make it run more efficiently: operator education.</p>
<p>Building systems are complex and interdependent. To get the most out of them, operators must be able to see the big picture. The Building Operator Certification® (BOC) program teaches facilities personnel to understand these systems and bring them collectively to peak efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the Energy Trust of Oregon is offering incentives to take this training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building Operator Certification® (BOC) trains and certifies building operators on the latest technologies and strategies for maintaining equipment, increasing occupant comfort, improving energy efficiency and reducing energy costs in their buildings. BOC is designed for building operators, custodians, maintenance staff and others interested in learning ways to save energy through building operation and maintenance.</p>
<p>Two levels of training are offered:<br />• Level I—Building Systems Maintenance (8 one-day classes)<br />• Level II—Equipment Troubleshooting and Maintenance (7 one-day classes)</p>
<p>Energy Trust of Oregon provides a cash incentive of up to $1,600* per building operator to help with the cost of completing Level I or Level II BOC training. Participants may not receive an incentive for both Level I and Level II certification within three years. This incentive is available for building operators regularly working in a commercial, multifamily, institutional or government building served by Portland General Electric, Pacific Power, NW Natural, Cascade Natural Gas or Avista.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energytrust.org/commercial/tools-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Energy Trust of Oregon Tools and Training">Energy Trust of Oregon</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">This engaging map is designed for a broad audience including educators, career-advisors, jobseekers, employers, policymakers, and workforce professionals. It demonstrates the breadth of the green buildings and energy efficiency industry, some of its critical occupations, and the multitude of advancement routes (over 300!) between jobs and sectors. The map also includes a section on “New-Collar” jobs within the industry—jobs that don’t require a traditional four-year degree, but rather rely on gaining skills through on-the-job training, high school technical education, on-the-job apprenticeships, vocational schools, technical certification programs, community colleges, the military, and internships. These 55 jobs have a mission to design, build, and operate high-quality, healthier, and more energy efficient homes and commercial and industrial buildings. We call them&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Green Buildings</span>!</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Green Buildings Career Map was developed by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council in conjunction with a team of subject matter experts from across the green buildings and energy efficiency industry. This group of experts convened to identify, organize and articulate many of the most in-demand jobs in the sprawling and complex green buildings and energy efficiency industry. It is important to note that the Green Buildings Career Map does not include jobs from the manufacturing and research sectors of the energy efficiency industry.</p>

<p>The Energy Management program has partnered with the University of Oregon (UO) and Oregon State University on two separate US Department of Energy Awards ($500k each) that fight Global Climate Change! The Energy Program has partnered with the UO Energy Studies in Buildings Lab (ESBL) to create the first-ever Building Energy and Controls Apprenticeship (BECA) program. The BECA prepares individuals who are searching for an employment path that helps to offset climate change. There are two components to the BECA, which are the LCC Energy Management two-year degree program,<strong> AND<em> 2000 hours of paid apprentice employment</em></strong> with local (to you) practitioners called Training Agents.</p>
<p>The DOE awarded the OSU Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) funds to create the Small Commercial Building Assessment Center (SCBAC), which will be operated under the IAC umbrella. OSU will hire LCC Energy and Water Conservation students as student employees to conduct energy audits in commercial buildings that are 100k square feet or less in size. The LCC Energy and Water program staff will train and oversee the commercial building audits and report writing.</p>
