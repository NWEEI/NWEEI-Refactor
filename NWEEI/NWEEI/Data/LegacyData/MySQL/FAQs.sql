INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (1,'How do I find out about the field work?','<p>Field work will be part of each class and explained at the beginning of each term. Instructors will be asked to introduce all relevant field work for their class no later than five weeks into the term. Exceptions may apply depending on the course and/or if a special or individual project is arranged.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (2,'How do I know for which field work I''ll be responsible?','<p>Each class will have a Fieldwork Mentor. In some areas the Fieldwork Mentor will be the same person - in other areas there may be a different Fieldwork Mentor for each class. The Fieldwork Mentor for a class will communicate with the course instructor prior to the beginning of the term to determine which field work projects are to be completed.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (3,'How do I prepare for the required field work?','<p>Depending on the course''s student learning objectives, field work preparation can be light or not so light. It is likely that the Fieldwork Mentor will simply perform his/her normal job duties and have a student along to learn what those duties might be. NWEEI staff will assist the Fieldwork Mentor with preparation.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (4,'Is there a process to negotiate conflicts between Fieldwork Mentors & students?','<p>Yes. We are working on documentation of the official process and will present it here once completed.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (5,'What happens if we aren''t able to schedule a time to meet?','<p>All students need a Fieldwork Mentor to complete the program. Every effort will be made to make arrangements to have the Fieldwork Mentor/Mentee meet but if it''s just not possible to make a meeting time, staff at NWEEI will try to locate an alternate Fieldwork Mentor.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (6,'What if I decide that Fieldwork Mentoring isn''t right for me?','<p>The expectation is that if a Fieldwork Mentor agrees to be a Fieldwork Mentor he/she will complete the course field work for that term.

The Fieldwork Mentor will have the opportunity to receive whatever evaluations and feedback is available.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (11,'Are Fieldwork Mentor paid for their time?','<p>At the current time - No. We are in the business of educating students and while we are unable to generate enough cashflow to be able to compensate Fieldwork Mentors for their time, there are many other benefits that will be realized by becoming a Fieldwork Mentor.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (12,'Can I hire a student who isn''t finished the program?','<p>We always encourage students to complete their educational objectives which may be finishing a two-year degree or simply obtaining employment after taking a few energy efficiency classes. One of the benefits of Fieldwork Mentoring is the potential of discovering a gem of an employee. If a Fieldwork Mentor is interested in hiring a Mentee, the decision to become an employee is up to the student. Because this is an online program, it is easier for students to work and continue their educational pursuits compared to a traditional classroom learning environment.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (13,'Can I pick my own student?','<p>While typically a student will be given a Fieldwork Mentor, there may be an instance where the Fieldwork Mentor will suggest that an individual enroll in the Energy Management Program which essentially is the Fieldwork Mentor selecting his/her Mentee.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (14,'Why be a Fieldwork Mentor?','<p>The benefits of being a Fieldwork Mentor are many. For the Fieldwork Mentor, the satisfaction of assisting an aspiring energy expert is huge and a way of paying forward through their own (Fieldwork Mentor''s) expertise.

Over the next few years, we will establish a pool of Fieldwork Mentors through the Northwest and then seek additional individuals where there is a geographical void!</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (17,'How many students will I have at one time?','<p>The number of students Fieldwork Mentored at one time depends on how many students have registered for one of our classes in the Fieldwork Mentor''s utility service area.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (18,'How much time will I need to invest in this?','<p>The amount of time a Fieldwork Mentor spends with his/her student will depend on the course in which the student is enrolled. Each course will have a specific lab or labs where the students needs assistance. The level of work is determined before the course begins.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (19,'How often will I be asked to assist students?','<p>The level of involvement will depend on the term. Each class has a different level of Fieldwork Mentor involvement. The program offers each course once a year. For instance, once our winter term Residential Energy has been offered, it will not be offered again until the next winter term so a Fieldwork Mentor who can demonstrate the use of a blower door will not be needed until then.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (20,'What does a Fieldwork Mentor do?','<p>A Fieldwork Mentor will meet with a student during a term in which the student needs to conduct field work to accomplish a course objective. Staff at NWEEI and/or the course instructor will communicate with the Fieldwork Mentor as soon as a student is registered in their service area. Once the term begins, it is up to the student to contact the Fieldwork Mentor directly and make arrangements to complete the work.

INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (22,'What makes this program unique?','<p>Most fully online programs do not have a lab or skill development requirement where students must go into the field to experience a theory learned in "class" which is typical for Career Technical courses. This program is unique because, as a career technical program, we require students complete field work with assistance from Fieldwork Mentors.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (23,'Beyond the field work, is there any additional paperwork I need to complete?','<p>Yes – but very little. </p><ol><li>Prior to any field work, you may be asked to fill out a webform or interview sheet that will allow us to determine if you''re able to provide the services and skills necessary to be Fieldwork Mentor. This allows us to match students up with Fieldwork Mentors who have the tools and skill sets needed to complete the field work. </li>\r\n<li>Your utility may be required to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) document that outlines the relationship and responsibilities of being a Fieldwork Mentor. </li>\r\n<li>You may be asked to respond to our 3rd party evaluation team. The responses should be quick and will both help us improve and verify that the project is successful. </li>\r\n</ol>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (24,'Do I have to bring my own tools?','<p>Typically, because our students are new to our industry, there is an expectation that they will not have accumulated a set of Analytical tools so yes, you will need to provide tools. The expectation is tools used will be limited to dataloggers and a set of sensors, a light meter, and maybe a blower door.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (25,'Do I have to evaluate the student''s lab work?','<p>At the end of the course, Utility Fieldwork Mentors will be expected to submit a simple electronic checklist. This quick evaluation mainly notes attendance and involvement. Faculty will use the checklist along with any additional feedback for grading.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (26,'Will I need to provide safety equipment?','<p>Perhaps. It is the Fieldwork Mentor''s responsibility to encourage a safe working environment. Notes about requiring closed shoes, hard hat, safety vest, gloves etc.. need to be discussed with student prior to showing up for their field work. Where there are activities or areas with safety hazards, it is up to the Fieldwork Mentor to give a safety brief and or confirm that the student is aware of those hazards.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (27,'How do I know if our utility has the fieldwork expertise?','<p>Depending on the course, your utility may or may not have the expertise to Fieldwork Mentor a student.

INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (30,'What is required to be a fieldwork mentor?','<p>We expect that a Fieldwork Mentor will have a deep understanding of residential and commercial buildings. We don''t expect that one Fieldwork Mentor will know it all although many do. We would like our Fieldwork Mentors to possess an interest in showing others the technical aspects of residential and commercial building energy consumption including HVAC, Lighting, building shell science, and occupancy behavior. </p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (31,'What happens if my student gets hurt? Who''s responsible for liability?','<p>By enrolling in a class at Lane Community College, all students are protected by the College''s liability insurance. However, because this program is a unique combination of online and fieldwork outside a physical campus, it''s a bit more complicated to explain. Rest assured, we have worked with both legal councel and our Fieldwork Mentors to construct documentation that provides the assurance that student safety is considered. Proof of coverage is available upon request.</p>',60,1,0);
INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (32,'How are students matched to fieldwork mentor?','<p>When a student registers for a class, his/her location will be identified through the registration process.

INSERT IGNORE INTO FAQs VALUES (101,'What is Energy Management?','<h3>Energy Management Defined</h3>
<p><em>An except from Roger Ebbage''s NRG 101 Introduction to Energy Managment Class</em></p>
<p>The first objective of any class in any discipline is to define the key term(s) of the discipline – which in this case is Energy Management. In Energy Management there are two working definitions that I cite. The first is where I wish we were culturally and that is,&nbsp; “Energy Management is the Socially Conscious Generation and Use of Energy that Promotes Sustainable Building Design and Use Resulting in a Livable Environment”. Pretty nice isn’t it? It means everyone is on board with saving resources in both energy generation and energy consumption for the good of all human kind (cue the music please).</p>
<p>Here is a more common, pragmatic definition of Energy Management. “The Judicious and Effective Use of Energy to Maximize Profits (minimize costs) and Enhance Competitive Positions”. In fact up until recently, economics have driven the deployment of energy efficiency equipment, appliances, and behavior adaptaion (change) regardless of the end-use (where the energy is used) environment. The most common question related to energy efficiency recommendations, from insulation to solar Photovoltaics is “what is the payback on….?”. In other words, how long will the energy savings take to pay back the investment made to purchase the – what ever! Of course the answer is “it depends!” What it depends on is what you’ll learn in this program. Can you guess what some of the topics will be?</p>
<p>In the Energy Management world, there are resources upon which we rely to give sage advice which I call "words from on high". The Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) in Snowmass, Colorado is one such resource and is at the pinnacle of energy efficiency information. Amory Lovins, PhD in both Physics and Economics, is the CEO/President of RMI and consults with heads of state on a routine basis. You can find their work at <a href="http://www.rmi.org">http://www.rmi.org</a>. Amory has authored a ton of papers, including his definition of not Energy Management but Energy Efficiency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Energy efficiency is not conservation by curtailment. It means doing more with less, enjoying more comfort, providing the same or better services, but doing it a little smarter”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds do able, right? RMI also gathers data/statistics. This is a little dated but here is a very interesting Stat!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“….since the Arab oil embargo in 1973, the United States has gotten more than four times as much new energy from savings as from all net expansions of domestic energy supplies put together”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are other definitions, but "using less energy to provide the same service" is a good operational one.</p>
<p><strong>The best way to understand this idea is through examples:</strong></p>
<blockquote>When you replace a single pane window in your house with an energy-efficient one, the new window prevents heat from escaping in the winter, so you save energy by using your furnace or electric heater less while still staying comfortable. In the summer, efficient windows keep the heat out, so the air conditioner does not run as often and you save electricity.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When you replace an appliance, such as a refrigerator or clothes washer, or office equipment, such as a computer or printer, with a more energy-efficient model, the new equipment provides the same service, but uses less energy. This saves you money on your energy bill, and reduces the amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere.</blockquote>
<h3>Again, energy efficiency is not energy conservation.</h3>
<p>Energy conservation is reducing or going without a service to save energy.</p>
<p>For example: Turning off a light is energy conservation. Replacing an incandescent lamp with a compact fluorescent lamp (which uses much less energy to produce the same amount of light) is energy efficiency.</p>',61,1,0);
